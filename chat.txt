On a side note here, while Ido uses very colorful language we don't usually call out people publicly even when they blatantly Kang our code with no regard. Have been cases of "Pro" well known devs in the community doing that. But we decided take a special case on this because of their sheer blataness by which they Kang our device commits from the 7t, write such terrible platform code, and then ask for donations based on using other people's work.

just read the proposed commit that was linked to in the comments here, that's about the funniest fucking shit
Avery Earl
Guardian pixel 3 or 7t? Which is better and why? Go
7T overall, better display, decent custom support, better cameras even if it's impossible to get them working half-decent let alone with gcam, 90hz refresh rate
Avery Earl
Wait better cameras on the op lol?

real jake
i mean
the wide angle
Avery Earl
Pixel is known for their cameras
Well
Quality wise

real jake
i mean it's pixel all the way
but i thought that's why gcam was a thing
Avery Earl
Hahaha yeah
Well yeah
But
Even with GCam
The hardware isn't exact
It's close
But pixel will outperform always imo
Have you ever had a pixel 3

real jake
yea
3a albeit but yea
my mom's got the 3a now
it takes great pictures
Avery Earl
How is the screen

real jake
it's alright
it doesn't have as many issues as the 7T had
but i mean
it's just another OLED
7T has the whole green tint thing which mine did
but it's not a deal breaker
Avery Earl
does the 60hz really make it feel alot slower

real jake
no but like
on my 7 pro
i'll toggle it
and it's smooth as fuck
Avery Earl
I have a 7 pro too lol

real jake
but like really, it's noticable but it's not too much better than 60Hz and it definitely isn't 120Hz
Avery Earl
And 7t
I just like the way the pixel looks

real jake
I like the 90Hz but my battery is kinda shitting itself
Avery Earl
Yeah haha

real jake
im also running a very very old revision of YAAP bc i dont wanna wipe my phone for the 15th time
but im about to do it anyway

to clean it off and start fresh
Avery Earl
Ohh okay

real jake
and debrand and everything
Avery Earl
How was the process of unlocking that bl lol
Did tmo have to help

no
i mean i think you have to have your phone paid off so you can bl unlock it

And my 8 pro wa seven worse like 3 hours

Aravindh Kumar
Hey Avery would you mind telling me how is the 1+ 8 pro since you own one
Thinking of buying it as sd888 and exy2100 overheats
Esp interested in cameras so how's the camera perf of 8 pro without gcam

Aravindh Kumar
Guys
I got asked "what's your reason to live?"
Avery Earl
To answer your question about the 8 pro
Don't waste your time with it tbh
It's an okay device but it's not impressive by any means
I returned it really fast

Aravindh Kumar
Well then okay I'm not gonna bother then
Avery Earl
I honestly wouldn't. I'm really picky when it comes to phones and what you're getting for like $700 is not worth it
It also depends on what device you have rn

Aravindh Kumar
Avery Earl
It also depends on what device you have rn
7T
Avery Earl
Yeah no don't buy one
I returned the 8 pro and bought this 7t like a couple days ago

Aravindh Kumar
That settles it:+1:
I'm gonna wait for the pixel 6
Avery Earl
Way better because it's a fraction of the cost and performs identically
Yeah way better idea

Aravindh Kumar
Thanks man
Avery Earl
I know this sounds crazy but if you're looking to upgrade to something that feels more premium the 7pro us honestly perfect. It has a sd 855 and thus phone has 855+ I can tell you there is close to no difference. Just food for thought. I really like my 7 pro and it feels like a nice flagship with the 4k screen

Aravindh Kumar
Avery Earl

I don't think I'm gonna buy a >2 year older phone
I agree it's a more premium device
I should have bought it instead of the 7T imo
But too late now
Avery Earl
Well you're right but 7t is just more practical for everyday use
Flat screen
No popup camera

Aravindh Kumar
And I'm happy with my 7T. Only reason I wanna upgrade is I want pixel like cameras without using GCam
Avery Earl
Easier to tuck away and not have to worry about
Yeah haha I feel you
Have you ever had a pixel 3?

Aravindh Kumar
No
Avery Earl
I found it for lik $200
I know it has a little bit old hardware

Aravindh Kumar
pixels aren't sold in my country
Avery Earl
But not slow by any means
What country ?

Aravindh Kumar
Only the pixel 4a is available
India
Avery Earl
Oh okay
Dude
I heard how bad covid is there

Aravindh Kumar
Yep
Around 5k deaths per day
Avery Earl
Are you in an area thats really bad rn

Aravindh Kumar
No fortunately I'm in a relatively safe region
Avery Earl
Good good
Are vaccinations even rolling out over there yet lol?

Aravindh Kumar
Thanks for asking rly thoughful of you:blush:
Avery Earl
Are vaccinations even rolling out over there yet lol?
Yeah but only to people older than 21 or something rn
Little by little
Avery Earl
That sucks
I got my 2nd dose the other day

Aravindh Kumar
Avery Earl
That sucks
Yeah
Avery Earl
That shit sucks
So bad

Aravindh Kumar
Avery Earl
I got my 2nd dose the other day
That's awesome man
Avery Earl
You'll feel like you got hit by a damn truck

Aravindh Kumar
Do you get any fevers or something?
Avery Earl
And have chills at night

Aravindh Kumar
Avery Earl
You'll feel like you got hit by a damn truck
Ah
Avery Earl
Yep

Aravindh Kumar
How are ya feelin now?
You are in the US I presume?
Avery Earl
Yep
I'm good now for the most part lol

Aravindh Kumar
How are things there?
Avery Earl
I mean covid honestly isn't really much of a concern around here, we still take caution and social distance but like it's honestly not scary anymore
Over half of the US have their vaccines

Aravindh Kumar
That's good to hear
Avery Earl
Look

Aravindh Kumar
At the start I heard the US was badly affected
Now it's affecting us
Avery Earl
Look
Hmm
Avery Earl
Yeah it was awful here

But again I think population is a point to consider
My state has 6 times the population of ohio
So yea
Avery Earl
Well
That would make sense then haha

Aravindh Kumar
I was shocked lol
Avery Earl
Yeah that's badddd
I think there's a ban now lol
Travel ban

Aravindh Kumar
Are you talking about here or there?
Avery Earl
both
biden banned people from india coming to the US

Aravindh Kumar
Oh probably a good thing
Avery Earl
tru

Aravindh Kumar
Hey Avery does los have aod?
Avery Earl
No clue
I didn't like it
I instantly reverted to yaap
It feels buggy and not very well developed

Avery Earl
It just isn't smooth
Is stutters
Phone gets a little warm
Not gonna lie I didn't have crazy high hopes for this rom before I flashed it hence the name but it literally is a whole project and it's so smooth and there are literally no bugs I've experienced

I am asking about that, because YAAP is good maintenaned rom, but I cant use rom without faceunlock. In this way, availability of the notch in this phone will be unjustified.
Im also used to this unlocking method.

Face unlock was available since 2011
Hell even the first galaxy s used to have those

Aravindh Kumar
Bruh
Why does OEMs push it then
Many implement it

Guardian AI Dusty
Aravindh Kumar
Many implement it
Usually it's only good for the devices which support 3d face unlock
Some mi devices support it
And huawei devices support it
And some more devices support it but I don't know much :joy:
Samsung used to implement iris scans which was also pretty secure :joy:
